    <h2 class="featurette-heading historyheading">History of the Downtown Lock Haven Rotary Club</h2>

    <p class="lead historytext">The Rotary Club of Downtown Lock Haven was founded March 13, 2003 by a group of individuals

        sponsored by the Lock Haven Rotary Club. The new club became chartered at a ceremony on April 1,

        2003 with 23 members on its roster. </p>


    <p class="lead historytext">Club meetings have been held at various locations, all within the City of Lock Haven’s downtown.

        Current meetings are held at Keystone Community Network (KCNet), 18 East Main Street, Lock Haven

        from 5:15pm to 6:15pm for fellowship, as well as interesting and informative programs dealing with

        topics of local and global importance. Most speakers are selected from Clinton County.

        Vocational tours are scheduled throughout the year, including visits to local businesses and nonprofit

        organizations. A new program started in June 2010 and still in effect is the once-a-month Rotary Round-

        up joint meeting of the three Rotary clubs in the immediate area. </p>


    <p class="lead historytext">Charitable activities have included gathering supplies for local nonprofit agencies like the women's center

        and the local food bank, and monetary donations to such agencies as the local library, SPCA, and United

        Way. In 2008, we initiated a project in conjunction with Downtown Lock Haven, Inc. to sell t-shirts and

        polo shirts with the Hometown Heroes program. This continues to be our signature project. Additionally,

        we sponsor banners in tribute to veterans in the Hometown Heroes Banner, program. We partnered with

        Downtown Lock Haven Inc., the Clinton County Community Foundation, businessman Steve Poorman

        and Brownies Signs to have a directional sign built and installed. The sign was installed across from the

        Courthouse and the amphitheater in 2011. In June 2013, we finalized plans for installation of a security

        camera for Tiger’s Den – a local playground for children. </p>


    <p class="lead historytext">Rotary of Downtown Lock Haven received a District Simplified Grant in 2007 to purchase a handicapped

        accessible toy car for the playground in Hanna Park, which is still in use today.

        Our club’s Rotary Friendship Banner was created by teen Lana Whitaker with advice from past Rotary

        member Rita Foley. </p>


    <p class="lead historytext">Each year we name a Downtowner of the Year, which is an individual or organization who demonstrates

        the spirit of Rotary in professional and volunteer efforts. The recipient represents and supports the 4-Way

        Test by being truthful, fair, building goodwill, and working to benefit downtown Lock Haven. </p>


    <p class="lead historytext">A Rotarian of the Year has been named annually beginning in 2005. This honor is presented to a Rotarian

        who follows the Object of Rotary to encourage and foster the ideal of service as a basis of worthy

        enterprise, fosters the development of an acquaintance as an opportunity for service, has high ethical

        standards in business and profession, applies the ideal of service in personal, business and community

        life, and advances international understanding, goodwill, and peace through a world fellowship of

        business and professional persons united in the ideal of service. </p>
